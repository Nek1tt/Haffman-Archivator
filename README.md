# Haffman-Archivator
My first-first +- good project - Haffman Archivator. I did this project in my 1st year at NSU, so it 100% has some bugs, but at least I have it running and working correctly. Some things in the project are made too simple, like parsing encoded text, because I couldn't figure out a way to put a tree in the text. I had to put the whole table inside. But nevertheless, the text is encoded and decoded. 
# What this do? 
You can encode text and decode it as well. I don't recommend encoding and decoding everything in one file. 
# Installation
I was working in VS 2022, it worked on it. Copy all the files to the VS 2022 folder and run the .exe file. 
# Usage
If you want to encode a file, select 1 and specify two paths, first the path where to look for the file to encode, second the path to the file where to save the encoded data. 

If you want to decode a file, select 2 and specify two paths, first the path where to look for the file to decode, second the path to the file where to save the decoded data.
